# Mexican Election Model Development Roadmap

## 1. Polling Data Framework

### A. Poll Weighting System
```
weight = sample_size_weight * pollster_rating_weight * recency_weight * methodology_weight

where:
- sample_size_weight = log(n)/log(max_n)  # n = sample size
- recency_weight = 1/(1 + days_since_poll)
- pollster_rating_weight = derived from historical accuracy
- methodology_weight = based on sampling methodology quality
```

### B. Essential Adjustments

1. **Likely Voter Adjustment**
- Develop Mexico-specific likely voter model based on:
  - Historical turnout patterns by region
  - Demographic voting propensity
  - Current election engagement metrics
- Calculate adjustment factors using:
  ```python
  likely_voter_adjustment = base_adjustment * turnout_factor * engagement_metric
  ```

2. **House Effects**
- Track systematic biases by pollster
- Calculate using hierarchical model:
  - State-level house effects
  - National-level house effects
  - Allow for different effects by party/candidate

3. **Timeline Adjustment**
- Implement decay function for older polls
- Weight recent polls more heavily near election day
- Account for major campaign events

## 2. Fundamentals Integration

### A. Economic Indicators
1. Primary Metrics:
- GDP growth rate
- Inflation rate
- Unemployment by state
- Real wage growth
- Consumer confidence index

2. Calibration:
- Use historical election results (1994-present)
- Weight recent economic performance more heavily
- Account for regional economic disparities

### B. Demographic Factors
1. Core Variables:
- Education levels
- Urban/rural population
- Age distribution
- Income levels
- Indigenous population percentage

2. Regional Characteristics:
- State-level partisan lean
- Historical turnout patterns
- Voting access metrics

### C. Enhanced Snapshot Creation
```python
def create_enhanced_snapshot(state):
    return {
        'polling_average': weighted_polls * poll_weight,
        'demographic_baseline': demographic_model * demo_weight,
        'economic_factors': economic_model * econ_weight,
        'historical_pattern': historical_model * hist_weight
    }
```

## 3. Uncertainty Quantification

### A. Components

1. **National Drift**
```python
national_drift = base_uncertainty * (days_until_election)**(1/3) * uncertainty_index
```

2. **Uncertainty Index Variables**
- Undecided voter percentage
- Economic volatility metrics
- News volume/significance
- Political polarization measures
- Campaign event impact

### B. Error Correlations

1. Regional Clusters:
- North/Border States
- Central Mexico
- Southern States
- Metropolitan Areas

2. Demographic Correlations:
- Urban/Rural splits
- Income levels
- Education clusters
- Indigenous population percentage

## 4. Simulation Framework

### A. Core Simulation Structure
```python
class ElectionSimulation:
    def run_simulation(self, n_simulations=40000):
        results = []
        for _ in range(n_simulations):
            # Generate national swing
            national_shift = generate_national_error()
            
            # Generate correlated state errors
            state_errors = generate_state_errors()
            
            # Apply demographic correlations
            demo_effects = apply_demographic_effects()
            
            # Calculate final state results
            state_results = calculate_state_results(
                national_shift, 
                state_errors,
                demo_effects
            )
            
            results.append(state_results)
        
        return aggregate_results(results)
```

### B. State Covariance Modeling
1. Geographic Factors:
- Border state effects
- Regional economic ties
- Media market overlap

2. Demographic Linkages:
- Urban population centers
- Indigenous communities
- Income/education clusters

## 5. Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- Set up data pipeline for poll collection
- Implement basic poll averaging
- Create preliminary state snapshots

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Weeks 5-8)
- Integrate economic indicators
- Develop house effects adjustment
- Build demographic baseline models

### Phase 3: Simulation (Weeks 9-12)
- Implement uncertainty quantification
- Build simulation framework
- Develop correlation structure

### Phase 4: Validation (Weeks 13-16)
- Backtest against historical elections
- Sensitivity analysis
- Parameter tuning

## Critical Considerations

1. **Mexico-Specific Factors**
- Multi-party system dynamics
- Regional party strength
- Coalition politics
- State election timing

2. **Data Quality Issues**
- Poll reliability verification
- Economic data timeliness
- Regional data availability
- Historical data consistency

3. **Validation Metrics**
- Brier score
- Calibration curves
- Backtesting framework
- Uncertainty quantification

## Next Steps

1. Immediate Actions:
